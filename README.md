# Website for EdgeLedger

A website for the imaginary EdgeLedger accounting firm. It is a single page website with Home, What, Who and Contact sections. It is built with CSS Flexbox.

The website is fully responsive.

Some jQuery and regular JavaScript has been used for smooth scrolling, showing google maps and for opacity on the sticky top menu.

Icons are taken from Fontawsome via CDN.

The contact form is not being submitted.

Responsiveness is tested on all formats in the Chrome browser.

The google maps API KEY has been left out, please put in your own.
